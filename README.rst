The Grain stream cipher is one of the phase 3 candidates of the eSTREAM project: 

http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/grainp3.html 

The main strength of Grain is its small hardware footprint. For example, on a Xilinx the stream cipher can be implemented using less than 50 slices. 


Features
========

* Implementations of both Grain-1 and Grain-128 
* Includes VHDL code and testbenches 
* Uses pure VHDL'93 with no architecture dependent elements
* Each stream cipher is implemented in a small and a fast version.
